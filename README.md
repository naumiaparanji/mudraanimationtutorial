# mudraanimationtutorial
One of my most loved passion projects!

Originally developed for the course HON 3310: Creativity at Work. 

I wanted to showcase the creativity in interdisciplinary collaboration - I've choreographed a dance of Lord Shiva in Bharatnatyam and utilized web development to bring this experience online and to the public!
